网址：http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/  

我们使用处理过的数据 in [SegNet-Tutorial](https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial/tree/master/CamVid), 为了保证不同数据库路径的统一性，对train.txt,test.txt,val.txt的路径稍微做了一点修改。

The following description is in [LinkNet](http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/1707.03718.pdf)

**CamVid**: It is another automotive dataset which contains **367** training, **101** validation, and **233** testing images. There are **eleven** different classes such as building, tree, sky,
car, road, etc. while the twelfth class contains unlabeled data, which we ignore during training. The original frame resolution for this dataset is 960 × 720 (W,H).
